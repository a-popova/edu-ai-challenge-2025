Step 1: Understand the Use Case
You're building a social platform that:

Has millions of users

Needs to store:

User profiles (structured data)

Posts (semi-structured or structured)

Connections between users (graph-like relationships)

Will experience 80% read operations, so read performance is critical

Requires scalability to handle growth

Step 2: Analyze the Data Types
User profiles and posts: Can be modeled as structured or semi-structured documents

Connections between users: This represents a graph, such as friends or followers

This indicates a mix of document and graph data models.

Step 3: Consider Database Requirements
High read speed: Suggests using an in-memory cache or a database optimized for fast queries (e.g., indexes, denormalized data)

Scalability: Cloud-native, horizontally scalable systems are preferred

Complex relationships (connections): Graph databases are ideal for traversing user connections quickly

Step 4: Evaluate Suitable Database Options
ðŸ”¹ Option 1: Document Store (e.g., MongoDB)
Good for user profiles and posts

Scales horizontally

High read performance with proper indexing and sharding

Can support basic relationships via references or embedding (but not optimal for deep graph traversal)

ðŸ”¹ Option 2: Graph Database (e.g., Neo4j or Amazon Neptune)
Excellent for modeling and querying user connections (friends, followers)

Supports deep relationship queries efficiently

Might not be as performant/scalable for high-volume reads on non-graph data like posts

ðŸ”¹ Option 3: Polyglot Persistence (Using Multiple Databases)
Use MongoDB or Cassandra for storing user profiles and posts

Use Neo4j or Amazon Neptune for storing and querying user connections

Combine with Redis for caching hot data and improving read speed

âœ… Recommended Approach
Polyglot Persistence:

Use MongoDB for user profiles and posts

Use Neo4j or Amazon Neptune for user relationships

Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data to meet high read-speed demands

This balances flexibility, performance, and scalability.

âœ… Final Answer:
Use a combination of MongoDB (for profiles/posts), a graph database like Neo4j (for user connections), and Redis (for caching and high-speed reads).
