There is a function implementation:

function processUserData(data: any) {
  var users = [];

  for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    var user = {
      id: data[i].id,
      name: data[i].name,
      email: data[i].email,
      active: data[i].status === 'active' ? true : false
    };
    users.push(user);
  }
  console.log("Processed " + users.length + " users");
  return users;
}

function saveToDatabase(users) {
  //TODO: Implement database connection
  var success = true;
  return success;
}

As an Experienced Developer reviewing the code:
1. Ensure code readability and maintainability (clear structure, naming, comments).
2. Identify potential bugs or edge cases for robust operation.
3. Check for adherence to coding standards and best practices.

As a Security Engineer reviewing the code:
1. Analyze for vulnerabilities (e.g., input validation, injection risks).
2. Assess proper handling of sensitive data (e.g., encryption, access control).
3. Verify safe use of third-party libraries and dependencies.

As a Performance Specialist reviewing the code:
1. Evaluate algorithmic efficiency (time and space complexity).
2. Identify bottlenecks or resource-heavy operations.
3. Recommend optimizations for scalability under high load.

For each perspective, provide specific, actionable recommendations and observations to improve the code.
