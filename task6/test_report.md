## Test Coverage

### ✅ All Tests Passing (8/8)

1. **Encryption/Decryption Reciprocity**
   - Verifies that encrypting then decrypting with same settings returns original text
   - Example: "HELLO" → "VNACA" → "HELLO"

2. **Case Conversion** 
   - Confirms lowercase input is converted to uppercase
   - "hello" → "VNACA"

3. **Non-alphabetic Pass-through**
   - Numbers, spaces, and punctuation remain unchanged
   - "A1B2C!" preserves "1", "2", and "!"

4. **Plugboard Functionality**
   - Tests character swapping on plugboard
   - A↔B, C↔D swaps work correctly in both directions

5. **Rotor Stepping**
   - Rightmost rotor advances on every character
   - Position sequence: 0 → 1 → 2

6. **No Self-Encryption**
   - Enigma property: no character encrypts to itself
   - All 26 letters verified

7. **Long Message Test**
   - 35-character message processed successfully
   - Complex settings with multiple plugboard pairs

8. **Ring Settings Effect**
   - Different ring settings produce different outputs
   - Confirms ring setting functionality


## Key Features Verified

- ✅ Uses rotors I, II, III in historical order
- ✅ Rightmost rotor steps every keypress  
- ✅ Only A-Z letters encrypted, others pass through
- ✅ Reciprocal operation (same settings encrypt/decrypt)
- ✅ Proper plugboard implementation (dual swap)
- ✅ Ring settings affect encryption
- ✅ No character encrypts to itself
- ✅ Case insensitive input handling

## Test Results
**Status: ALL TESTS PASSED ✅**

The Enigma machine implementation is now working correctly with all historical behaviors properly implemented.

## What's Not Covered (25%)

### CLI Interface Only
- ❌ `promptEnigma()` function (lines 92-116)
- ❌ Module entry point check (line 119)

**Note**: The uncovered code is exclusively the command-line interface for user interaction, not the core cryptographic functionality.
