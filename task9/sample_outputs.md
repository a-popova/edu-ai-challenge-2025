The iPhone changed everything in 2007, but before that, there was the Macintosh, and in between, the iPod basically revolutionized how people listened to music. Critics say the company’s grip on its ecosystem is too tight, with complaints from developers and users who want more flexibility, especially around repairs and sideloading. People often mention the premium prices—Apple doesn’t aim to be affordable, it aims to be iconic. Yet, despite the cost, millions flock to each product release. Apple became the first U.S. company to hit a $1 trillion market cap in 2018, a milestone that solidified its dominance, though some say innovation has slowed in recent years. Still, there’s a fanbase that sticks with Apple no matter what, citing things like device longevity, resale value, and the way everything just kind of works together. The target audience is broad but leans heavily toward creatives, professionals, students, and anyone who wants their tech to feel luxurious. Apple makes its money through more than just hardware—the App Store is a massive engine of revenue, taking a cut from developers, and subscriptions to services like iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple TV+ now play a growing role. Under the hood, Apple builds a lot in-house—Swift, Metal, macOS, iOS, custom A-series and M-series chips, 
you name it. They're all about vertical integration, which helps create that polished, controlled experience. AI and machine learning are woven throughout its software, though Apple tends not to shout about it the way others do. Somewhere in there, you’ve got features like Face ID, iCloud syncing, Handoff, and accessibility tools that fans rave about—these come late in the conversation but are central to the experience. The company’s software and services blend across devices almost invisibly, which many users love, even if they don’t always realize it’s happening. Still, some Android or Windows users looking in might feel boxed out. Apple doesn’t make open systems; it makes walled gardens that bloom beautifully—for a price.
