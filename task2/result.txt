Attempt to log out by clicking the logout button in the top navigation bar.

Expected vs Actual Behavior

User should be logged out of the application and redirected to the login screen (or appropriate landing page).

Actual:
Nothing happens when the logout button is clicked. No visual feedback or navigation occurs.

Environment (if known)

OS: macOS Sonoma 14.4

Application version: [Insert version if applicable]

Logged-in user role: [Insert role, e.g., Admin, Regular User]

Severity or Impact
